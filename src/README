Contains
  boundary.f90
  control.f90
  diagnostics.f90
  initial_conditions.f90
  radiative.f90

-----------------------------------------------------------------
control.f90

control.f90 contains all the code parameters, such as the number of gridpoints, the length of the domain, the physics packages used, parameters for the packages etc.

It is subdivided into three subroutines
user_normalisation - User sets the parameters used in the code normalisation
control_variables - User sets the basic code parameters. See the comments in the code for a full description
set_output_dumps - User sets the information to be included in the output dumps from the code.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
initial_conditions.f90

initial_conditions.f90 controls the initial conditions for the simulation. It contains only a single subroutine, called "set_initial_conditions", where the user must set the initial conditions for the variables

rho - density
energy - specific internal energy
v{x,y,z} - Velocity in all three directions
b{x,y,z} - Magnetic field in all three directions
-----------------------------------------------------------------
boundary.f90

boundary.f90 controls the boundary conditions for the code. Details on the boundary conditions and how to change them are given in the LARE manual
-----------------------------------------------------------------
diagnostics.f90

diagnostics.f90 performs the output of data to the output dump files, and must be changed by the user if additional output data is required. Changing the output dumps is described in the LARE manual
-----------------------------------------------------------------
radiative.f90

specify user defined radiative losses and heating functions
-----------------------------------------------------------------
